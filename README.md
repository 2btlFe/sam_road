Official codebase for paper "Segment Anything Model for Road Network Graph Extraction" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16051.pdf

TODO(Congrui): I'll work on adding docs and cleaning up codes.

Otherwise this project shouldn't have any weird dependencies, just latest pytorch and pip install whatever missing should work. Feel free to dig in.
